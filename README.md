TeraPy is a graphical interface for scientific measurements. It is designed for sequential scanning processes.

TeraPy is based on a modular architecture, which makes it easily extensible. Several components can be extended by addition of separate module files with well-defined specifications. The main features of TeraPy are:

- modular scan event system and scan sequence definition
- modular post-processing filters
- modular device driver system
- modular plotting architecture
- modular file input/output filters

TeraPy is developed at the Photonics Institute of Vienna University of Technology (http://www.photonik.tuwien.ac.at) by Vincent Paeder and Daniel Dietze. TeraPy was originally developed for our activities in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (hence the name), but can be used in a much wider range of sequential measurement processes.
